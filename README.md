The domain of our application is to represent the relationships present in a real estate management system. The primary responsibility of this system is to manage real estate transactions between property owners, buyers, and agents, focusing on the process from listing a property to completing the sale. The system also involves other important activities such as property inspections and payment tracking. Our goal is to model the life cycle of a real estate transaction â€” from a property being listed, inspections being carried out, and agreements being made, all the way to payments and ownership transfer.

The database will model the entities that include Property, Owner, Buyer, Agent, Sale Agreement, Inspection, and Payment, along with their respective attributes. In addition, the database will model the relationships between them, including:
  - ownership (one owner can own multiple properties),
  - sales agreements (facilitated by agents for buyers and owners),
  - inspections (carried out on properties),
  - payments (tied to sale agreements).
